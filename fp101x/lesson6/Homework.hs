-- Exercise 11 --

{- Consider the following higher-order function unfold :: (b -> Bool) -> (b -> a) -> (b -> b) -> b -> [a] that encapsulates
   a simple pattern of recursion for producing a list.-}

unfold :: (b -> Bool) -> (b -> a) -> (b -> b) -> b -> [a]
unfold p h t x
  | p x = []
  | otherwise = h x : unfold p h t (t x)

{- The function unfold p h t x produces the empty list if the predicate p x is True. Otherwise it produces a non-empty
   list by applying the function h x to give the head of the generated list, and the function t x to generate another
   seed that is recursively processed by unfold to produce the tail of the generated list.

   For example, the function int2bin, that converts a non-negative integer into a binary number, with the least significant
   bit first, can be defined as:

   For example: -}

type Bit = Int

int2bin :: Int -> [Bit]
int2bin 0 = []
int2bin n = [n `mod` 2] : int2bin(n `div` 2)

{- > int2bin 13
   [1, 0, 1, 1]
   > int2bin (-0) -- Yes, 0 can be negative!
   []
   This function can be rewritten more compactly using unfold as follows:
-}

int2binB = unfold ( == 0) (`mod` 2) ('div' 2)

{- Next consider the function chop8 :: [Bit] -> [[Bit]] that takes a list of bits and chops it into lists of at most
   eight bits (assuming the list is finite, non-partial, and does not contain bottom): -}
chop8A :: [Bit] -> [[Bit]]
chop8A [] = []
chop8A bits = take 8 bits : chop8A (drop 8 bits)

chop8B :: [Bit] -> [[Bit]]
chop8B = unfold null (take 8) (drop 8)
